## 🎯 Objectives
- **Identify** high-performing rental properties based on average rating, pricing, and return behavior.
- **Analyze** trends across property types, locations, and customer segments.
- **Recommend** pricing strategies and quality improvements to reduce return rates and improve occupancy.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Included
- `Property Name / ID`  
- `Location / Region`  
- `Price per Night`  
- `Average Rating`  
- `Number of Reviews`  
- `Return Rate (%)`  
- `Property Type` (e.g., Apartment, House, Cabin)  
- `Is Superhost` or `Verified Listing`

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Properties with consistent high ratings and moderate pricing tend to have the lowest return or complaint rates.
- Return rates were elevated in properties with fewer reviews or inconsistent amenities.
- Pricing below market average does not guarantee higher ratings or satisfaction—experience quality plays a major role.
- Verified or “Superhost” listings showed stronger performance across all categories.

---

## 🧠 Assumptions
- Return rate is used as a proxy for customer dissatisfaction or booking cancellations.
- Rating and review volume are reliable indicators of guest satisfaction and trust.
- Property type and location meaningfully influence performance metrics.
